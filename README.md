# AIML-Target-source-Mapping

In the setup of clinical trials, there is a persistent challenge in mapping source models to standard clinical industry-specific data models. To streamline this process, I explored the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective was to leverage AIML to generate a vocabulary that captures column names, data types, and sizes. This approach aimed to facilitate the identification of accurate and relevant matches between the source and target datasets.
